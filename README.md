# Bubble Trouble

## Background 
**Bubble Trouble is an exciting game. The main goal of the game is to get rid of all bubbles on the screen. The way you do that is with your character. You move around with your left and right arrow keys and then press space to shoot at the bubbles on the screen. 
 When shot, the bubbles will break into two smaller bubbles and will continue to do this until they are to small to break any further. You will have 5 lives and everytime you get hit by a bubble, you lose one and the game resets!**
 
 
 ## Functionality & MVPs
 In Bubble Trouble, users will be able to: 
  * Move left and right and shoot at bubbles on the screen
  * Have 3 lives
  * Lose a life when they collide with a bubble
  * Have a timer to end the round.
     * When timer gets to 0 and there are still bubbles left, you lose a life.
     * If you destroy all bubbles, you move on to the next round
  * Experience different levels of difficulties by moving on to next round
     * Levels will get harder by having larger and more bubbles.
  * Have a current score showing how they are doing
  

In addition, this project will include:
  * Instructions on how to play the game and the rules
  * A production README
